GroundControlwithoutRadio: Runs on the ground control arduino without the XBee.
Sends craft health monitoring information to the PC with Labview, and sends control flags to the craft.


Serial connections:
	-Serial: PC with Labview
	-Serial2: GroundControlwithRadio
	
	
setup():
	-Begins serial connections
	-Sets up pins for hardkill button
	
loop():
	-Reads XBee packet and saves it to health_StateString
	-Checks if there is a connection to the PC with labview. 
		-if there is no connection:
			-If hardkill button is pressed, sends abort string to craft and turns on arduino's LED
			-If it isn't pressed, sends nothing
		-If there is a connection, 
			-gets command string
				format: "h:"<command flags>';'<command string length>'|'
			-If hardkill button is pressed, adds abort flag to string and turns on arduini's LED
	-Sends command packet to GroundControlwithRadio and health_StateString to PC with Labview
