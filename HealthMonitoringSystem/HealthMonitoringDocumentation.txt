Overview: This sketch runs on the health monitoring arduino, which is the arduino on the craft that has the XBee. It takes the data from the pressure sensors, thermocouples(pixhawk), voltage sensor and XBee (such as data from ground control and whether the connection is valid or not). It then sends this data over XBee to ground control while at the same time saving it to the SD card. This sketch also ontrols the dump valves and the safety.



Libraries used:
SPI		- used for communication with thermocouples

SD		- used for saving data to SD card

SoftwareSerial	- used for communication with thermocouples

String		- used for XBee communication

ctype		- umm.....

EEPROM		- used for saving data so arduino

MAX31855	- used for communicating with thermocouples

Servo		- used for dump valve operation


Pinouts: sets pins for valves


Servo: gives name to various valve servos


Servo Defaults: Gives default positions for servos


SD Card: creates file for recording sensor data


Power Relay: sets pins for power toggle


Pressure Transducer: sets pins for pressure sensors


Max/Min Pressure Values: sets maximum and minimum values for pressure


Max/Min Temperature Values: sets max and min values for temperature

Voltage Sensor: sets pin for voltage sensor


Xbee input flags: creates and sets multiple boolean flags for the commands that can be sent to the craft


Thermocouple: communication with pixhawk


setup: 			-begins serial

			-sets servo motors to default

			-turns on power relay

			-starts sd car

d
loop:			-gets sensor data

			-sends & saves sensor data


errorFlagsEvaluation:	-checks sensor values + sends errors as needed

sendDataOverSerial2:	-communication to pixhawk

stateFunctionEvaluation:-writes data to sd card

			-resets sd card?

			-allows actual sensing of all sensors
						-allows valve usage

			-resets stuff

			-evaluates error flags


resetErrorFlags:	-turns errors off


PressureTransducerRead:	-reads pressure data


voltage_sensor: 	-reads voltage data


initThermocoupleMonitor:-begins communication with pixhawk

readThermocouples:	-reads thermocouples


sendHealthPacket:	-formats health package with varios flags
					-sends health packages to XBee


readFlags:		-checks for incoming flags from the Xbee

Serialflush flushes the serial buffer on arduino = SUPER IMPORTANT
