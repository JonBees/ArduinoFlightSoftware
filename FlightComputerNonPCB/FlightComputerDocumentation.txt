FlightComputer: Runs on Puma's arduino without the XBee.
Reads servo values from a text file named PWMCOORD.txt, refreshed every 100ms.


Serial connections:
	-Serial: can connect via USB
	-Serial2: HealthMonitoring arduino


setup():
	-begins serial connections
	-attaches to servos
	-sets servos to defaultValues
	-initializes SD card and checks for pwmcoord.txt
	
loop():
	-checks input flags
	-reads next four servo values, assigns them to currentValue[]
	-if softkilling, decreases the servo values by SOFTKILLDECREMENT
	-if aborting, sets the servo values to abort values
	-sends packet of current servo values (prefixed with "m:") to health monitoring arduino (if not aborting)
	-sets all servos to currentValue[]

	
Input Flags:
'a' - abort: immediately sets all servo values to abort values
'o' - begins the code (take_off)
'r' - reset: resets counter
'k' - softkill: moves all servo values to 1000 (closed) at 10 per each 100ms loop.
'p' - profile: begins flight profile simulation. runs through all values in the file, then sets them all back to the defaults (closed).
