GroundConttrolwithRadio: Runs on the ground control arduino with the XBee. 
It takes a radio input from the XBee and sends it to an adjacent arduino as an intermediate step which will ultimately go to the ground control arduino without radio. 
This is beacuse the arduino Mega could not read Xbee data and send via USB at the same time.

Serial connections:
	-Serial: PC with Labview (for power)
	-Serial1: XBee
	-Serial2: GroundControlWithoutRadio

setup():
	-Begins serial connections

loop():
	-Reads characters from GroundControlWithoutRadio, sends them to XBee
	-Reads characters from XBee, sends them to GroundControlWithoutRadio
