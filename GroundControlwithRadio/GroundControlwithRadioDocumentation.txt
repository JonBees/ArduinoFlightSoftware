GroundControlwithRadio: Runs on the ground control arduino with the XBee. 
It takes a radio input from the XBee and sends it to the GroundControlWithoutRadio.
This is necessary beacuse the arduino can't read Xbee data and send via USB at the same time.


Serial connections:
	-Serial: PC with Labview (for power)
	-Serial1: XBee
	-Serial2: GroundControlWithoutRadio

	
setup():
	-Begins serial connections

loop():
	-Reads characters from GroundControlWithoutRadio, sends them to XBee
	-Reads characters from XBee, sends them to GroundControlWithoutRadio
